 # Explanation
"After the end of message byte (<$0D>) is sent by the receiver, the automation computer will respond with an ACK (<$06>) or NACK (<$15>). 
This response can be delayed between 1 byte time (depending on the baudrate) and the ACK timeout period.
If the receiver doesnâ€™t get a response within the ACK timeout period or receive a NACK from the automation
computer, it will retransmit the data."
